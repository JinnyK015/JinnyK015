                When I was working in the cafÃ© most staff were on temporary visas. And that cafÃ© didnâ€™t give us
                contracts and did some unfair things to us. I tried speaking to the boss, but he wouldnâ€™t listen. So, I
                gathered evidence from my coworkers and took our complaints to the boss. Even though I ended up quitting
                that cafÃ©, they gave us contracts and changed some of the unfair things.

                My country has an extremely competitive environment and it started in childhood. If I wanted to survive
                and keep my condition or get a better position I had to work hard and be sensitive about what is unfair
                or fair. So, I grew up in that environment, I really love it when everyone, including me is hardworking
                and I think finishing work is so important, even if it is not perfect.

                My strengths are honesty about my situation, I enjoy learning new things and I like clear communication.
                Limitations are I have quite high standards. If I feel Iâ€™m quite bad at something sometimes I can become
                quite negative towards myself. If my team member didnâ€™t work hard and was unprofessional at the work
                place I would not happy with that too.

                A strength would be my resilience. I will keep going with my studying, even if it is hard and I donâ€™t
                give up easily. Also, learning something new feeling makes me happy. An obstacle for me is if I felt
                stuck for too long, I might want to give up. So, I want to go to offline classes, because even if I
                stuck and want to give up if someone else has similar experience to me it helps me feel better.

                In my previous job as a supply chain manager my factory team and sales team often argued with each
                other. So, I had to understand everyoneâ€™s goals and I listened to everyoneâ€™s needs and their situation.
                After that I would negotiate with them and try to get them to compromise. It wasnâ€™t always successful,
                but at least they knew negotiating was better than losing out completely. I will always try to negotiate
                first, but in the end, I would have to consider who has seniority in the relationship (For example the
                client)
