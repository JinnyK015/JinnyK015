                When I was working in the café most staff were on temporary
                visas. And that café didn’t give us contracts and did some
                unfair things to us. I tried speaking to the boss, but he
                wouldn’t listen. So, I gathered evidence from my coworkers and
                took our complaints to the boss. Even though I ended up quitting
                that café, they gave us contracts and changed some of the unfair
                things.

                My country has an extremely competitive environment and it
                started in childhood. If I wanted to survive and keep my
                condition or get a better position I had to work hard and be
                sensitive about what is unfair or fair. So, I grew up in that
                environment, I really love it when everyone, including me is
                hardworking and I think finishing work is so important, even if
                it is not perfect.

                My strengths are honesty about my situation, I enjoy learning
                new things and I like clear communication. Limitations are I
                have quite high standards. If I feel I’m quite bad at something
                sometimes I can become quite negative towards myself. If my team
                member didn’t work hard and was unprofessional at the work place
                I would not happy with that too.

                A strength would be my resilience. I will keep going with my
                studying, even if it is hard and I don’t give up easily. Also,
                learning something new feeling makes me happy. An obstacle for
                me is if I felt stuck for too long, I might want to give up. So,
                I want to go to offline classes, because even if I stuck and
                want to give up if someone else has similar experience to me it
                helps me feel better.

                In my previous job as a supply chain manager my factory team and
                sales team often argued with each other. So, I had to understand
                everyone’s goals and I listened to everyone’s needs and their
                situation. After that I would negotiate with them and try to get
                them to compromise. It wasn’t always successful, but at least
                they knew negotiating was better than losing out completely. I
                will always try to negotiate first, but in the end, I would have
                to consider who has seniority in the relationship (For example
                the client)
